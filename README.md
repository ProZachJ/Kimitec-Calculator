Interactive calculator for mixing Kimitec Fertilizers

Goal: Use AngularJS to create an interactive calculator to help people mix Kimitec fertilzers for use in smaller quantities than liters per hectare.

Intended Usage: Imbeded Iframe.

Should it scale to fit the iframe it's imbeded in or popout? Maybe scale with the option to popout?
